## [v1.2.0]

The first version of the `@rstacruz/gatsby-remark-component` fork, based on Hebilicious's v1.1.3.

- **Updated build system** &mdash; all build tools were updated. Babel was updated v6 → v7, Jest v22 → v24, Rollup v0.55 → v1, Prettier (new), and many more! The built files were also removed from the repo, and are instead generated on-demand when publishing to npm.

- Remove extraneous `console.log` outputs
